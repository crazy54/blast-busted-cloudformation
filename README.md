# RVTools Synthetic Data Generator

## Overview

This project contains a Python script (`rvtools_data_generator.py`) designed to generate a set of synthetic CSV files that mimic the structure and content of exports from the popular VMware data collection tool, RVTools. The generated data is randomized but aims to provide a realistic-looking dataset for testing, demonstrations, or developing data processing pipelines that consume RVTools exports.

The script can generate all 24 common CSV files produced by RVTools, with inter-dependencies between some entities (like VMs being on specific hosts, which are in specific clusters/datacenters) to enhance realism.

## Contents

1.  **`rvtools_data_generator.py`**:
    *   **Purpose**: The main Python (3.x) script that generates the synthetic RVTools CSV files.
    *   **Structure**:
        *   `CSV_HEADERS`: A dictionary defining the column headers for all 24 RVTools CSV files.
        *   `CSV_GENERATION_ORDER`: A list defining the order in which CSVs are generated to help build context (e.g., generate hosts before VMs).
        *   `SHARED_CONTEXT`: A global dictionary used to store and share generated entity data (like DC names, cluster names, host details, VM details) across different CSV generation processes. This helps in creating linked and consistent data.
        *   **Generator Functions**:
            *   Basic data type generators (e.g., `generate_random_string`, `generate_ip_address`, `generate_datetime_string`).
            *   Entity-specific generators (e.g., `generate_vm_entity`, `generate_host_entity`) that create detailed records for entities and store them in `SHARED_CONTEXT`.
        *   `generate_csv_file()`: Core function that takes a CSV type, its headers, number of rows, and column generation strategies to produce a single CSV file.
        *   `column_strategies`: Defined in `main()`, these dictionaries map each column in each CSV to a specific generation function and its arguments, or specify how to source data from `SHARED_CONTEXT` or `current_row_context`.
        *   `zip_generated_csvs()`: A utility function to collect all generated CSV files into a single zip archive.
    *   **Running Locally**:
        *   Requires Python 3.x.
        *   Standard library dependencies: `csv`, `random`, `string`, `uuid`, `zipfile`, `os`, `inspect`. No external packages are needed.
        *   Execute from the command line: `python rvtools_data_generator.py`
    *   **Output**: The script will create individual CSV files prefixed with `generated_` (e.g., `generated_RVTools_tabvInfo.csv`) and then consolidate them into a single zip file named `RVTools_synthetic_data.zip`.

2.  **`AI_PROMPTS.md`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Provides a collection of sample, detailed prompts for generating more nuanced or contextually rich data for specific columns using a Large Language Model (LLM).
    *   **Usage**: The prompts are designed to be used with an external AI model. The output from the AI can then be manually inserted into the generated CSVs or, for advanced use, the `rvtools_data_generator.py` script could be modified to:
        1.  Call an LLM API using these prompts.
        2.  Incorporate the AI's responses into the data generation process for designated columns.
    *   **Placeholders**: Prompts include placeholders like `[VM_NAME]`, `[OS_TYPE]`, `[DATACENTER_NAME]` which should be replaced with actual data generated by the script for other columns in the same row or related entities to provide better context to the AI.

## Workflow

1.  **Run the Generator**:
    *   Execute `python rvtools_data_generator.py` in your local Python 3 environment.
    *   The script will print to the console as it generates each file.
    *   Upon completion, a `RVTools_synthetic_data.zip` file will be created in the same directory, containing all the generated CSV files. Individual `generated_*.csv` files will be removed after being zipped.

2.  **(Optional/Advanced) Enhance with AI-Generated Data**:
    *   Refer to `AI_PROMPTS.md` for example prompts for specific columns that could benefit from more human-like or contextually complex data.
    *   Use your preferred AI model/tool with these prompts, substituting placeholders with relevant data from the already generated CSVs (or by temporarily modifying the script to output this contextual data).
    *   Manually update the specific fields in the generated CSVs with the AI's output.
    *   Alternatively, advanced users could modify `rvtools_data_generator.py` to integrate directly with an AI API, using the `generate_ai_data` function as a starting point.

3.  **Use the Data**:
    *   Unzip `RVTools_synthetic_data.zip` to access the individual CSV files.
    *   Use these files as input for testing data processing tools, for demonstrations, or for any scenario where RVTools-like data is required without access to a live VMware environment.

## Known Issues

*   **Timeouts in Restricted Environments**: The script, in its full complexity (generating all 24 files with inter-dependencies and many rows), has been observed to time out in some sandboxed or highly restricted Python execution environments. This is likely due to cumulative processing time for complex strategy execution and entity linkage rather than a single blocking call.
    *   **Mitigation**: If timeouts occur, try reducing `num_rows_per_csv` in `main()`, or limit the number of files generated by modifying `CSV_GENERATION_ORDER` or the main generation loop. For local execution on a standard machine, this is generally not an issue.
*   **Data Realism**: While the script aims for plausible data, it is still synthetic. Complex relationships or specific configuration details found in real-world VMware environments may not be perfectly replicated. The `AI_PROMPTS.md` file is provided as a means to address some of this for specific fields.

## Customization

*   **Number of Rows**: Modify `num_rows_per_csv` in `main()` to generate more or fewer rows per CSV file.
*   **Data Content**:
    *   Adjust the lists within `SHARED_CONTEXT` (e.g., `os_names`) to change the pool of available options.
    *   Modify the logic within individual `generate_<type>_entity` or `generate_<type>` functions to alter the patterns or ranges of generated data.
    *   Refine `column_strategies` in `main()` to change which generators are used for which columns or to provide different arguments.
*   **Specific Overrides**: For a particular CSV and column, you can provide a very specific generator or even a list of fixed values within its `column_strategies` definition.
